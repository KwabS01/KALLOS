                    <h2>Hair Extensions</h2>
                    <p>Hair extensions are a great way to either extend
                     the length of your hair and/or add some volume to it. 
                     Clients turn to us mostly for this service when preparing
                      for their big day and their hair didn’t reach the length
                       they had in mind for the wedding. On many occasions, 
                       we’ve helped clients who suffered some sort of damage
                        to their hair due to home colouring or home haircut gone 
                        bad. And recently, we had the privilege to help a dear
                         client who was a combination of the two: Preparing for 
                         her big day, and also wanting to cover up some damage....</p>

                    <h2>Hair Coloring</h2>
                    <p>Hair coloring, or hair dyeing, is the practice of changing the
                     color of the hair on humans' heads. The main reasons
                      for this are cosmetic: to cover gray or white hair, 
                      to alter hair to create a specific look, to change a 
                      color to suit preference or to restore the original hair 
                      color after it has been discolored by hairdressing 
                      processes or sun bleaching....</p>
